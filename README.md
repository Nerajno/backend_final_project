This project was created as a part of my capstone project for my Flatiron Immersive Course. 

The Front-end is currently hosted and can be viewed on [Netlify](https://native-treats.netlify.com/).

## Premise
Native Treats is a Single Page Application that helps that users to find exotic restaurants in a specific location, 
save/delete these restaurants to their profile, comment on these restaurants and rate them.
